- 👋 Hi, I’m @Xtrugen
- 👀 I’m a medical student based in the UK with an interest in the application of computer science in the fields of biology and medicine.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python3 - I'm just getting started in the world of CS. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any small scale projects to help me improve my skills. I'm working towards being proficient in data science, but my main priority is to build good CS fundamentals currently.
